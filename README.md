# Leco: Le Embedded CoffeeScript templates

Leco is reimplementation of [Eco](https://github.com/sstephenson/eco), partly
because of NIH, partly because I wanted to play with writing template compiler,
partly because I was not satisfied with how original implementation was
structured and in here I was responsible for everything.

It works largely as Eco, but supports custom tag types, so you can add your own
tags, i.e. `<%_ ... %>` for i18n and whatnot.

Proper description will follow. I guess.
